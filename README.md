# DVHacks - Tinco

## Project Introduction

Tinco is an virtual assistant or chatbot for solving DMV waiting problems. 

#### Problem

People spend hours or even days in many DMV sites to have their vehicle registration renewed, ID/DL renewed.
The existing online digital applications or Kiosks are unintuitive, confusing and limited. 

#### Solution
